## About

A guide and reference to help people get started with React Native.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Running Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The first time it may take a little while to generate the first `webpack-assets.json` and complain with a few dozen `[webpack-isomorphic-tools] (waiting for the first Webpack build to finish)` printouts, but be patient. Give it 30 seconds.

## Building and Running Production Server

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Demo

The production version of this app is running [here](http://www.reactnativeexpress.com).
